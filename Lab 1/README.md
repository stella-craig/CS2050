This is the first lab for my CS2050 course at the University of Missouri.
This lab tested over pass by reference and error codes.

The instructions for the lab that was given to me are in the Lab1B.pdf file.

The main.c file is meant for testing the functions created in the lab1.c file. 
I ran these files in Linux shell using the command: gcc lab1.c main.c -Wall -Werror.
