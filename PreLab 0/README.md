This is the first prelab for my CS2050 course at the University of Missouri.
This prelab tested over arrays and served primarily as a mini review of last semester.

The instructions for the lab that was given to me are in the PreLab-0-Instructions.pdf file.

The main.c file is meant for testing the functions created in the prelab0.c file.
I ran these files in Linux shell using the command: gcc prelab0.c main.c -Wall -Werror.
