This is the fifth lab for my CS2050 course at the University of Missouri.
This lab tested over structs and struct pointers, with some pointer arithmetic.
The main.c file is meant for testing the functions created in the lab5.c file.
I ran these files in Linux shell using the command: gcc lab5.c main.c -Wall -Werror
